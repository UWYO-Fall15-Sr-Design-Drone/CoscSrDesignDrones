This is an overview for the ImageEdit code that will combine our map images into a master images

Must have core requirements:
1.	Loads a series of images to program memory.
2.	Figures out the orientation that the images were taken from on the drone.
3.	Combines images onto a single page 

Secondary program design goals:
1.	A basic API so that the app on the phone can simply pass the program the images and a config file to worth with. 
2.	A transparency fade between map images. 

“Nice to have” design ideas:
1.	Run everything from a config file so that other programs may edit that instead of running the imageEdit program. 
2.	Pull basic GPS info off the images and parse their data. 


Things to keep in mind: 
	-We are going to have to figure out the orientation that the image was taken from
		-Could use the GPS info from the photo? This needs to be looked at
-Might have to go inside the flight planner config file, scrape and parse that data to figure out how the images were taken in relation to the flight path.

Problem: Javascript can't touch things it doesn't know about it. 
No way to handle to do an directory listing on a folder and pull the images in. 
What we can do, because we were talking about doing this on a webserver is first running a unix command
something like "ls | grep .jpg > imageDir.txt" should pull all our images from the current directory and 
save the list to a folder. Could run this all with a simple bash script too. 

Then we know for a fact that this file will always exists we can build a parser inside the Javascript code to to run like: var _image+count.scr.load(x,y) to dynamically pull this stuff in. 

This idea could fail here. Don't know if Javascript can dynamically add new vars.
