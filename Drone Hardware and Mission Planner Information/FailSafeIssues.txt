// Comment about some failsafe info, GCS does not affect us, but the other two apply to controller as well. 

 There are two basic conditions which can trigger a failsafe.  One is a loss of control signal.
  Normally this means a loss of the radio control RC signal.  However if rc override from the
  GCS is in use then this can mean a loss of communication with the GCS.  Such a failsafe will be
  classified as either short (greater than 1.5 seconds but less than 20) or long (greater than 20).
  Also, if GCS_HEARTBEAT_FAILSAFE is enabled and a heartbeat signal from the GCS has not been received
  in the preceeding 20 seconds then this will also trigger a "long" failsafe.
 
  The SHORT_FAILSAFE_ACTION and LONG_FAILSAFE_ACTION settings determines what APM will do when
  a failsafe mode is entered while flying in AUTO or LOITER mode.  This is important in order to avoid
  accidental failsafe behaviour when flying waypoints that take the aircraft
  out of radio range.
 
  If SHORT_FAILSAFE_ACTION is 1, when failsafe is entered in AUTO or LOITER modes,
  the aircraft will head for home in RTL mode.  If the failsafe condition is
  resolved, it will return to AUTO or LOITER mode.

  If LONG_FAILSAFE_ACTION is 1, when failsafe is entered in AUTO or LOITER modes,
  the aircraft will head for home in RTL mode.  If the failsafe condition is
  resolved the aircraft will not be returned to AUTO or LOITER mode, but will continue home

  If XX_FAILSAFE_ACTION is 0 and the applicable failsafe occurs while in AUTO or LOITER
  mode the aircraft will continue in that mode ignoring the failsafe condition.

  Note that for Manual, Stabilize, and Fly-By-Wire (A and B) modes the aircraft will always
  enter a circling mode for short failsafe conditions and will be switched to RTL for long
  failsafe conditions.  RTL mode is unaffected by failsafe conditions.
 
  The default is to have GCS Heartbeat failsafes DISABLED
  The default behaviour is to ignore failsafes in AUTO and LOITER modes.
 
//#define GCS_HEARTBEAT_FAILSAFE        DISABLED
//#define SHORT_FAILSAFE_ACTION         0
//#define LONG_FAILSAFE_ACTION          0
